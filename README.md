# de-hate
Using A.I. to fight hate speech and toxicity online online using opt-in moderation. Here I use Tensorflow.js toxicity detection models to detect nuanced toxicity in text both in browser and user submitted.

### Note that this A.I. is made to detect bad words so the demos have some bad words in them

This scans some pre-populated text for toxiciy and hides possibly toxic material under html spoiler tags so users can still see it if they want. This effectively allows for a browser to scan any page for toxicity.
